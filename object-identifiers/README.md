### Get an object identifier root

- You can get a part of the OID keyspace by requesting it from authority
- I found this link from an LDP side that gives a link for requesting one from the IANA
https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/How%20To%20Get%20Your%20Own%20OID
- I have officially submitted for one! My request is : REQUEST-98457


 ### Contact ANSI for their org list
 - I emailed isot@ansi.org to see if they have an up to date list like the IANA does.
